## 🤖 AI Features

### 1. Threat Narratives
Automatically generated after each simulation
```python
ai_advisor.generate_threat_narrative(attack_type, score, events)
# Example: "The attack successfully bypassed your firewall and 
# established C2 communication..."
```

### 2. Intelligent Recommendations
Smart upgrade suggestions based on weaknesses
```python
ai_advisor.generate_intelligent_recommendations(
    attack_type, score, weakest_stages, upgrades
)
# Returns: priority, immediate_actions, upgrade_suggestions, strategy
```

### 3. Strategic Analysis
Overall defense strategy assessment
```python
ai_advisor.analyze_defense_strategy(
    total_simulations, avg_score, attack_breakdown, invested
)
# Example: "Your defenses are strongest against Phishing but weak against APT"
```

### 4. Attack Insights
Deep analysis of specific attack types
```python
ai_advisor.get_attack_insights(attack_type, success_rate)
# Explains attacker tactics, why effective, and countermeasures
```

### 5. Budget Optimization
AI suggests optimal upgrade purchases
```python
ai_advisor.suggest_optimal_upgrades(budget, upgrades, stages, history)
# Returns: recommendations with expected improvements
```

## 📈 Performance Notes

### Database Optimization Tips
- Indexes on: user_id, attack_type, created_at
- Archive old simulations after 1 year
- Cache analytics reports
- Use pagination for history

### AI API Optimization
- Cache AI responses (same input = same output)
- Rate limit AI calls ($1 = ~1000 requests)
- Async generation for better UX
- Consider local models for cost savings
